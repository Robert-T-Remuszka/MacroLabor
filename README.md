# Getting Up and Running
0. All code in this repo assumes that the working directory is set to `code`.
1. [Globals.do](code/Globals.do) contains relative file paths used by the `.do` files. You should notice that one of the file paths points to a folder titled `data`. You will have to set this
folder up before executing any of the scripts here. <mark>Raw data files that populate the `data` folder are available upon request.</mark>
